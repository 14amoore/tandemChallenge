## This is my submission for the Tandem Code Challenge

I created this project using Create React App and React Bootstrap.\

## To run the code:

Clone this repo.\
Once you've cloned the repo navigate to it using the command line.\
Now that you're in the local copy of the repo type "npm i" to download the dependencies.\
Finally, when all of the dependencies are downloaded type "npm run start" and you'll be able to practice your trivia skills!

#### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
